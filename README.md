## Lightroom Plug-in: Remove unneccessary RAW files and keeping corresponding JPG

This is a plugin for people who shoot RAW+JPG in their cameras.
After having decided which RAW file to move forward to, and giving them a high (4+) rating
this plugin can be used to mark the lower graded RAW files with "rejected" and then adding the sidecar
JPG file to the catalogue and also any collections that the RAW files was present in.

The RAW files with a high grade will be kept as is.

NOTE: This will not generate JPG files from lower marked RAW files, only add an already existing
JPG file if that exists!
